        <p id="pAboutMe">Hello everybody, welcome to my site. I would like to introduce myself a little bit so everybody can understand my motivation for starting this magnificent site.</p>
        <br>    
        <p>I was born in 1978 in a village called Desserttown, where I learned to make desserts while tied up and blindfolded at the early age of 3.
        In this town we ate nothing but desserts all day long and in our free time we prepared the desserts (97.8% of current residents have some form of diabetis). </p>
        <br>
        <p>When I was ready to go to high school I already mastered all the skills necessary to make every single dessert known to man, so going to school was not an idea worth thinking about. 
        With the expertise I gained throughout my childhood I decided to go working at a dessert restaurant, named the Yummytummy. As soon as I started working there i got promoted to top chef of the restaurant, with my new position I decided to fire the whole staff and do all of the work myself. 
        12 years went by and I was ready for the next step in my career, I decided to run for president of the USA (Useless Sugary Abominations Club (the club is silent)), a club for dessert enthousiasts like myself. 
        Things lined up for me anyway because I got fired for inapropriate behaviour towards costumers, and attempting to fire staff without the authority to do so.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway, after getting into the club I was made the official assistent of the club without any hessitance, I had to preform challenging tasks such as picking up phones, and getting coffee for the club members.
        That basically brings us to today, where I am still a succesfull assistent. As the assistent I have been given the dificult task and personal responsibilty to create a site about desserts, you may also notice that I don't use any of my own recepies, this is no accident. 
        I wan't to keep my recepies as secret as possible, so I copy recepies from other sites, I hope you understand. I hope this was of any help to anybody, to explain why I created this site. Stay delicious folks, peace out!</p>
